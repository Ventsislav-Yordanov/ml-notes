# Machine Learning
Maching learning is a field about training a computer algorithms using data. It's a subset of the artificial intellgence field. Machine learning algorithms use a data for a task to catch the relationship between the indepedent variables and dependent variable. This is know as the "training process". Once we have a trained machine learning model, it could be used to make predictions on new data. These algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications like email spam detection, face recognition, text to speech, etc.
